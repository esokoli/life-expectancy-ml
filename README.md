##Final Project README
For our final project we decided to analyze life expectancy and other values possibly related to it such as the Human Development Index, BMI and health expenditure. The goal of this project to use techniques learned in class with R and other techniques we have used outside of this class to create an analysis of this data. We utilized visualizations, different statistical tests and k-fold cross validation modeling, among other techniques.

##Deliverables
This Zip file contains the following: 
 
data (folder) - This is the data we used for our analysis. It is provided in .csv format. 

Final_Project.Rmd - This file is where we wrote out all our code. To run the code, just enter the R Markdown document and run through the project (we recommend doing this step by step as it is a big file). 

Final_Project.html - This is the html document created from the Rmd file. You can open it up in any normal web browser. 
dictionary - List of what each column header means. 

##Running the tests
The only thing you need to do to run the tests are to open the rmd file and run it or you can look at the html file to see all the outputs. A relative path has been included in order to load the data.
